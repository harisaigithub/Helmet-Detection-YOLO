# Helmet Detection with YOLOv3

## About
This project leverages the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model for real-time helmet detection. It is designed to detect helmets in images, providing accurate and fast results with bounding boxes and confidence scores. The application is built with Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for image uploads and detection visualization.

## Objectives
- Implement real-time helmet detection using the YOLOv3 model.
- Provide an interactive web interface for users to upload images and view results.
- Display detection results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
- Create a personalized, easy-to-use application with Streamlit for accessibility and real-time performance.

## Summary
The Helmet Detection application uses YOLOv3, one of the most efficient object detection models, to identify helmets in images. This solution enables users to upload images and get instant feedback on helmet detection through visual representation (bounding boxes and confidence scores). The web application is hosted on Streamlit, allowing easy interaction and accessibility.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Detection:** Fast, accurate detection of helmets in images using the YOLOv3 model.
- **User Interface:** Streamlit-based UI for easy image uploads and result visualization.
- **Bounding Boxes & Confidence Scores:** Visual feedback with real-time detection details.
- **Personalized Sidebar:** Information and contact details for easy communication.

## Libraries and Technologies Used
- **Streamlit:** To build the interactive web application.
- **YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once):** For object detection, specifically helmet detection.
- **OpenCV:** For image processing and applying the YOLO model.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations and image data manipulation.
- **Pillow:** For image handling and processing.
  
## Data Source
The dataset used for training the YOLOv3 model includes images with helmeted and non-helmeted individuals. The model is optimized for detecting helmets in various environments.
